title: Idiomatic Idiocy
---
I've been a Python developer for a long time. A LONG time. I remember being excited to compile Python 1.5.2 when it was released, kinda long time. I've put in the time and I've learned the language in and out. I've learned to think in a Pythonic way, and can often intuitively write code that would be considered idiomatic Python. This has made for a wonderful and fruitful career as a formidable Python developer. Except, it's also held me back, because I am precisely that: a _Python_ developer. I've spent so much time and energy focused on becoming proficient in this language that I've forgone general proficiency as just a developer. Don't get me wrong, I can understand most other languages and have dabbled in writing bits of them over the years. But Python has always been my primary focus and my specialty.

This fact has not been lost on me. I've been aware of it for a long time. And for some time, I was good with it; I reveled in the fact. I even went more specialized at one point and was focused on becoming solely a strong Django developer.

Then I realized, I wanted more. I decided that I wanted to be not just a Python developer, but a _developer_. So I started up the [Facet MUD Project](https://github.com/Facet-MUD-Project) with some friends, and set out on learning some new languages. The intent was to build up the same project in multiple languages, and following the idioms of those particular languages. And this latter part is where I went wrong.
