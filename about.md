Hi, I'm Joey. But my friends call me The Joey. There's a story behind that, but I'll leave that for another time.

I like code. In fact, I've liked code for a very long time. Why? Because making things work is fun! Even more fun is taking something from a mere concept and making it into a reality. Even more more fun is seeing people using (and breaking) that thing!

I also like rock climbing. And cars. And beer. But those aren't really related to this. For the most part. Sometimes.

Oh yeah I have a kid too, and she's pretty awesome.
