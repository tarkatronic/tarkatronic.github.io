                    <p>
                        With over 20 years of professional experience, I thrive
                        in senior and staff level positions where I am able to provide immense
                        value to my employer and team on high-level problems, while retaining
                        the ability to dive in and work on technical minutiae. I have a
                        lengthy, proven track record of technical leadership,
                        mentorship, system architecture, and consistent
                        delivery on projects. I am highly passionate about
                        continually cultivating engineering culture, open
                        source engagement, and helping to level up my fellow
                        engineers through mentoring and leading by example.
