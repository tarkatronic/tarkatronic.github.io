                        With over 20 years of professional experience, I am
                        ready to step into a Staff or Principal engineering
                        role, where I can provide immense value to the company
                        on high-level problems, while retaining the ability to
                        dive in and work on technical minutiae. I have a
                        lengthy, proven track record of technical leadership,
                        mentorship, system architecture, and consistent
                        delivery on projects. I am highly passionate about
                        continually cultivating engineering culture, open
                        source engagement, and helping to level up my fellow
                        engineers through mentoring and leading by example.
