  I love beer. And whiskey. Sometimes I fear that love is not mutual.

  Life is like a handle of whiskey, consumed in a single night. In the
  beginning you're excited and certain you're going to tackle like a champ.
  Halfway through you realize just how difficult this really is, and that you
  should have started with a better strategy. By the end, you're ready to just
  be done with it and uncertain of what the aftermath will hold in store for
  you. Also, it's much better when shared with others.

  The mountains are a lot like honey Badgers. They do not care, and they WILL
  hurt you.
