    This is our attempt at making a Colorado Mountain spiced mead. We started out with what I would describe as "Juniper Berry Tea". To that, we added a combination of Clover and Alfalfa honey sourced from right here in the Rocky Mountains.

    We plan to split this in secondary fermentation into 5 different 1-gallon batches. One will stay just juniper; the others will have other spices added to see how the juniper plays with other flavors.

    The same base grain bill as our Rhubarb Berliner Weisse, with the addition of salt & coriander to make it a Gose... and then lime juice and peel, orange juice and peel, agave syrup, and French oak chips soaked in a Plata tequila! Far from a traditional beer, and a totally unknown ABV due to the tequila, but a lovely interpretation of a classic Margarita, in beer form.

    This batch was a happy little mistake. I didn't end up getting nearly as much conversion from the grains as I wanted, and ended up a full percentage point lower on ABV than intended. So instead of using this as the base for a few more complex beer I had planned, this just got bottled off and turned into a lovely, absolutely crushable, lightly fruity, lightly hoppy beer. Blonde? Slightly hazy pale? Who knows? Who cares! It's delicious!

    This delightful little peach of a blonde is like a perfect slice of the south, but born right here in Colorado. With the smooth, silky juiciness of the peaches, and just a subtle hint of oak and bourbon, her rebellious side manages to peek out from behind her sweetness.

    This hazy IPA was the very first recipe I started creating, and by far the most complex grain bill. Turning out to be FAR too large of a batch for my system, it didn't come out quite as expected, but ended up being something with extreme promise and worthy of future iterations.

    After being laid off in November 2023, I wanted to create something light and refreshing, and very inexpensive to brew. This used Mystery-X hops grown in my back yard as first wort hops, producing a very subtle hop note. This may have been an accidental clone of Bud Heavy.

    Attempting to re-capture the magic of an accidental amber we created long ago, we accidentally created this lovely Scottish Export ale instead. In fact it's so tasty that not only will we be re-brewing it soon, but it will be our first beer entered into a real competition: <a href="https://weizguys.com/revenge/">Sweetheart's Revenge 2024</a>!
