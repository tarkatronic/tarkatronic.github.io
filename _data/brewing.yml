    This is our attempt at making a Colorado Mountain spiced mead. We started out
    with what I would describe as "Juniper Berry Tea". To that, we added a
    combination of Clover and Alfalfa honey sourced from right here in the Rocky
    Mountains.

    We plan to split this in secondary fermentation into 5 different 1-gallon
    batches. One will stay just juniper; the others will have other spices added
    to see how the juniper plays with other flavors.

    The same base grain bill as our Rhubarb Berliner Weisse, with the addition
    of salt & coriander to make it a Gose... and then lime juice and peel,
    orange juice and peel, agave syrup, and French oak chips soaked in a Plata
    tequila! Far from a traditional beer, and a totally unknown ABV due to the
    tequila, but a lovely interpretation of a classic Margarita, in beer form.
